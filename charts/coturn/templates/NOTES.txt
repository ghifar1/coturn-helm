Thanks for installing Coturn.

{{- if .Values.hostNetwork }}
This release runs with host networking enabled. Exposed ports
3478/udp, 3478/tcp, 5349/udp, and 5349/tcp are available directly on each node
hosting a pod.
{{- else if .Values.service.enabled }}
The TURN service is available via Service {{ include "coturn.fullname" . }}.
{{- else }}
No Service has been created. Enable `service.enabled` in values to expose TURN ports.

Update `turnserver.config` to match your realm, authentication secrets, and
network settings before using this deployment in production.
